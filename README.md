Add ratings to netflix pages

![preview](http://i.imgur.com/VbSZGjC.png)

## Purpose
I hate going onto netflix and not seeing what ratings things have, so the intention is to use this as the backend, speaking to the OMDB API to gather ratings, then inject the ratings onto the netflix page via a chrome extension

## Usage

Title search

*GET*
`/title/:title`
